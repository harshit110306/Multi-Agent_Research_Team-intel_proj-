# 🧠 Multi-Agent Research Team (MART)

> An Autonomous AI-Powered Research Collaboration System
> Simulating a Real-World Research Lab Using Multi-Agent Intelligence

## 🚀 Overview

**Multi-Agent Research Team (MART)** is an AI-driven collaborative research system where multiple intelligent agents work together to conduct end-to-end research — from literature review to model development and final research paper generation.

Unlike traditional AI assistants that only summarize content, MART simulates a **real research laboratory**, where specialized agents:

* Generate hypotheses
* Detect research gaps
* Analyze data
* Build and optimize models
* Debate methodologies
* Audit bias and ethics
* Generate IEEE-style research papers

This system demonstrates advanced concepts in:

* Multi-Agent Systems
* Autonomous AI
* Distributed Intelligence
* Research Automation
* Responsible AI

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern research workflows are:

* Time-consuming
* Fragmented
* Manually coordinated
* Difficult to reproduce

Researchers spend excessive time on:

* Literature review
* Experiment tuning
* Reproducibility checks
* Documentation

MART addresses this by creating a **collaborative AI research ecosystem**.
